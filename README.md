**Introduction**

This project involves the derivation and implementation of a SIMPLE-based solver for turbulent incompressible flow using a k-epsilon turbulence model.
Performance of the solver is to be demonstrated on a backward-facing step test case. The source code involves a mesh class, generalised discretisation schemes, classes to discretise the governing equations and a SIMPLE class.

To run an example simulation, run the /scripts/run_simulation.sh file.
